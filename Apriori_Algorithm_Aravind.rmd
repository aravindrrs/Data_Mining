```{r apriori1}
library(arules)
alpha=read.transactions('C:/Users/tony stark/Desktop/data mining assignments/p5/alpha.txt',format='basket',sep=",")
inspect(alpha)
rules<-apriori(alpha,parameter=list(supp=0.6,conf=0.0))
inspect(rules)
```
From the set of 18 rules listed above, we have items {E,K,O} with support of 0.6 in the last three rows of the association rules. This indicates that the frequent item set after all the iterations is {E,K,O} given the support thershold of 0.6. This also confims what we obtained manually for the Apriori algoritm.

``` {r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
image(alpha)
itemFrequencyPlot(alpha,support=0.6)
