# Data_Mining 
Some of my projects in Data mining with Python

I have added the .html output since I dont have the copy of my ipython notebook book files (.ipynb) . 
In order to view these html files :
1. Click the .html file link 
2. Once it opens up in git, add the following (without quotes) " http://htmlpreview.github.io/? " before the url of the opened page.
 For eg: if after clicking one of the html pages, the url is "https://github.com/aravindrrs/Data_Mining/blob/master/Text%20Mining%2C%20Classification%20Algorithms%20comparison.html " , add "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aravindrrs/Data_Mining/blob/master/Text%20Mining%2C%20Classification%20Algorithms%20comparison.html" . This should give the exact html output that I exported from the ipython notebook.
3. you can also go to the site " https://htmlpreview.github.io/ " and paste the document url in the box provided in the site to view the html page.
