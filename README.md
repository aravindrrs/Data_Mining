# Data_Mining
Some of my projects in Data mining with Python


<h3>To view HTML files</h3>
I have added the .html output since I dont have the copy of my ipython notebook book files (.ipynb) . 
In order to view these html files :<br>
1. Click the .html file link <br> 
2. Once it opens up in git, add the following (without quotes) " http://htmlpreview.github.io/? " before the url of the opened page.<br>
 For eg: if after clicking one of the html pages, the url is "https://github.com/aravindrrs/Data_Mining/blob/master/Text%20Mining%2C%20Classification%20Algorithms%20comparison.html " ,<br>
 add "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aravindrrs/Data_Mining/blob/master/Text%20Mining%2C%20Classification%20Algorithms%20comparison.html" .
 This should give the exact html output that I exported from the ipython notebook. <br>
3. you can also go to the site " https://htmlpreview.github.io/ " and paste the document url in the box provided in the site to view the html page.

<h3>Note</h3>
The repository is just to showcase my projects using python. The codes are shown with their outputs and can be run in ipython notebook.<br>
I request that it may be used as a reference for your work and not copied entirely! <br> 

Projects are based on Data sets that I used.
